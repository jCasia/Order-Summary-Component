## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ A brief overview of the Frontend Mentor - Order summary card solution

The challenge was to build this component and get it looking as close to the design as possible
One of the main feature would be that the user should see hover states for interactive elements

What I found the most challenging was probably the naming of classes and also I was unsure of the actual height of the card
